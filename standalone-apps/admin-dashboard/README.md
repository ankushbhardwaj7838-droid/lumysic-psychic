# LUMSIC Admin Command Center (Standalone App)

This is the standalone Administrator Control Panel for LUMSIC. It is completely separated from the public user-facing website and features strict role-based access control (RBAC) powered by Firebase Authentication and Firestore Security Rules.

## Security & Authentication
- **Role Enforcement:** Only users with role `admin` can authenticate and access the dashboard.
- **Super Administrator:** The primary administrative account is `bankush014@gmail.com`.
- **Database Rules:** All database modifications are guarded by `firestore.rules` which strictly prohibit non-admin users from reading or writing administrative records.
- **No API Secrets:** No API keys or backend credentials are exposed in the frontend client.
